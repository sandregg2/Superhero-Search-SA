Description

Users will be able to search a database of superheros by name. Users will be able to select a superhero by their name and picture, and view their various stats.
When the User clicks on a superhero in their search they will be redirected to a page that lists the character's stats.
Users can then add superheros that they find interesting to a "favorites list". This favorites list will be available whenever the user returns to the site.

User Story

As a user I want to search for my favorite superheros, as well as superheros I may not have heard of. I want to know how powerful they are, and how these heros stack up against each other.
I want to be able to save a list of my favorite heros to view them at a later date.
